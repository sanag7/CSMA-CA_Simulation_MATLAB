# CSMA/CA Simulation
MATLAB Simulation of CSMA/CA Protocol for Wireless Communication

Designed a simulator to analyze the utilization of a wireless network performing CSMA/CA with random
backoff.

Computed the utility as a function of the number of nodes (N) for the following backoff strategies;

1. 802.11 
2. Additive increase multiplicative decrease 
3. Multiplicative increase multiplicative decrease 
4. Additive increase additive decrease
5. Multiplicative increase additive decrease
